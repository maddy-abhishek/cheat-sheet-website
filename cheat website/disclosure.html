            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A few weeks ago, I started using affiliate links on my blog. Thus,
                according to the US rules of the FTC, I have to write a “Disclosure Policy” to inform my readers.

                I make money when my visitors click on a link and create an account on the website. Sometimes, this can
                only be when the created account switches to a paid version.

                I may accept some free products and write an article about it. I only do this if I endorse the product
                100%. My opinion will always be truthful and will never be influenced by receiving a product for free.
                If you are a company and would like us to work together,
                Earning a little money allows me to maintain this blog. As I write these lines, my income is always in
                the red and I never realized a net profit.

                There is no consequences for you if you click on one of my affiliate links. All it will do is give me
                some commission, so THANK YOU!
            </p>
