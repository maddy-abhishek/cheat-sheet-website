        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A cheat sheet is composed of one or more papers that we are allowed to
            use during an
            exam, as a reminder. One can generally put the formulas necessary for the resolution of exercises in
            mathematics and physics for example. For my part, I always put examples that go with the theory, so as
            not
            to forget anything during the exam.</p>
